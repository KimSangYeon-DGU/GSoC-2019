## Abstract
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is widely used in computer vision as a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm. This project proposes Quantum Gaussian Mixture Model (QGMM) for Quantum Clustering and it is originally proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09199.pdf). In this project, we implemented QGMM and conducted some experiments to see if how fast it trains, how better it models the data, what edge cases there are, and there is anything we can improve.

## Researches
We conducted 7 researches to find out the stengths and weaknesses QGMM has.
### 1. Interference phenomena
According to paper, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?cos(\phi)" title="cos(\phi)" /> has an effect on the mixture case. Therefore, we checked its impact by visualizing it in 3D plotting. 
### 2. Validity of the objective function
### 3. Lambda impact
### 4. Phi modeling
### 5. Mixed clusters
### 6. Multiple clusters
### 7. Comparison with GMM
