<b>Abstract:</b> Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is widely used in computer vision as a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm and it is originally proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09199.pdf). In this project, we implemented QGMM and conducted some experiments to see if how fast it trains, how better it models the data, what edge cases there are, and there is anything we can improve.
